# Polimi IoT

My solutions for the challenges of the Internet of Thing course at Polimi during the academic year 2023/2024.

## Challenges

### First Challenge

The first challenge was a simple IoT system simulating a parking sensor.

The system consists of a sensor that detects the presence of a car in a parking space and then sends a message to a sink node that stores the data.

### Second Challenge

The second challenge was to analyse a Wireshark capture of CoAP/MQTT/MQTT-SN communication between multiple clients and servers.

In the end, there were some questions to answer about the packets exchanged.
